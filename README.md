This Amazon scraper is an innovative tool that harnesses the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate and enhance the web scraping process on Amazon's platform. Controlled by an LLM agent, this scraper can intelligently navigate product listings, reviews, and other relevant data while adapting to changes in the website's structure.
Key Features:

    LLM-Powered Decision Making: The scraper utilizes an advanced LLM to interpret user queries and dynamically adjust its scraping strategy. This means it can understand complex requests, such as "Find the top-rated wireless headphones under $100" or "List all products with free shipping," and execute them efficiently.
    Browser Automation: By employing a browser automation framework, the scraper mimics human browsing behavior. This approach helps bypass common anti-bot measures while ensuring compliance with Amazon's terms of service.
    Data Retrieval Tools: The scraper integrates with various data retrieval tools that allow it to fetch and process information from multiple sources. For instance, it can retrieve product details, pricing, availability, and customer reviews seamlessly.
    Customizable Output: Users can specify the format and type of data they want to extract. Whether it's structured data for analysis or raw HTML for further processing, the scraper accommodates various output needs.
    Real-Time Adaptation: The LLM agent continuously learns from interactions and can adapt its scraping logic based on observed changes in Amazonâ€™s layout or content structure, ensuring consistent performance over time.

Use Cases:

    Market Research: Businesses can leverage this scraper to gather competitive intelligence by monitoring product prices, trends, and customer feedback on Amazon.
    Price Tracking: Users can set up alerts for price changes on specific products, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions.
    Product Analysis: Researchers can analyze customer reviews and ratings to derive insights about product performance and consumer preferences.
